## Strasbourg place detection

Image recognition models for Strasbourg pictures such as monuments, squares, status, building from Strasbourg

The purpose of this project is to improve the following skills :

- Video and image preprocessing with OpenCV
- Deep learning with Keras Tensorflow
- Use of Flask and Dash framework
- Deploy a model training script in a docker container on a Google Cloud Engine
- Automate the cloud provisioning with Terraform
- Deploy the model on a dockerized app on Google Cloud Run.

The project is still under development and can be visited there : [Strasbourg image recognition under development](https://strasbourg-pictures-2cf54jn4da-ew.a.run.app/)
